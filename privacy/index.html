    <h2 id='privacy-policy'>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Our privacy policy is that we exist to protect your privacy and other human rights.</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s why <a href='https://small-tech.org'>we</a> do <a href='https://small-tech.org/about/#small-technology'>what we do</a>.</p>

    <h3 id='what-data-do-you-gather-when-i-visit-this-site'>What data do you gather when I visit this site?</h3>

    <p><strong>No data that is linked to you is collected or stored by us as you browse this site.</strong></p>

    <p>This site runs on <a href='https://sitejs.org'>Site.js</a>. </p>

    <p>Site.js collects <em>aggregate</em> access statistics that are ephemeral (they reset when the server restarts). This is mostly useful for us to see how much traffic the site is getting and notice broken links or the occasional misconfigured bot or hack attempt.</p>

    <p><a href='https://web0.small-web.org/21849627d58b1c71895a6b059b40cfd8'>View latest ephemeral statistics.</a></p>

    <h3 id='what-data-do-you-gather-if-i-sign-the-manifesto'>What data do you gather if I sign the manifesto?</h3>

    <p>When you sign the manifesto, we collect two types of data. Data about you and data about the signatory (which might also be you or it might be a project or organisation that youâ€™re signing on behalf of).</p>

    <p>(A) Data about you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>Your email address</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(B) Data about the signatory:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Name of signatory</li>
      <li>Web address of signatory</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Data about you (A) is not displayed on the site and only used for the following purposes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>To know who is signing the manifesto on behalf of the signatory and to have a means to communicate with you</strong> should, for example, someone representing the signatory (e.g., project or organisation) inform us that you do not have permission to sign the manifesto on their behalf.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>To send you transactional email</strong> to confirm your email address (to reduce the likelihood of spam/fraudulent signatures) and to inform you that your signature has been accepted and provide you with a link to delete your signature and the data about you (A) thatâ€™s linked to it should you want to in the future.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>To reply to you should you contact us</strong> with questions or requests.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will not use your name or email address for any other purpose although we may have to hand over the information should we receive a subpoena to do so. (Although what use it will be to anyone is beyond us as we store no other data about you.)</p>

    <p>Data about the signatory (B) is displayed in the signatory list on the site.</p>

    <h3 id='how-long-do-you-keep-my-data'>How long do you keep my data?</h3>

    <p>If you sign the manifesto, we keep the data in Groups A and B for as long as your signature remains on the manifesto.</p>

    <h3 id='how-can-i-get-my-data-removed'>How can I get my data removed?</h3>

    <p>If you signed the manifesto, you will have received a confirmation email that contains a link you can follow to delete your signature.</p>

    <p>Deleting your signature from the manifesto will also delete the linked data that is not displayed (your name and your email address).</p>

    <p><em>If you lost your confirmation email with the deletion link, please email Laura and Aral at <a href='mailto:hello@small-tech.org'>hello@small-tech.org</a> from the address you used to sign the manifesto and we will delete it for you.</em></p>

    <h3 id='do-you-use-any-third-party-services-to-host-this-site-and-what-data-do-they-have-access-to'>Do you use any third-party services to host this site and what data do they have access to?</h3>

    <p>This site is hosted on a Hetzner VPS.</p>

    <p>You can <a href='/privacy/hetzner-dpa-2021-12-30.pdf'>download and read the GDPR data processing agreement we have with Hetzner</a> <small>(PDF; 199KB)</small>.</p>

    <p>Other than that we do not use any other third-party services for the hosting of this site.</p>

    <h3 id='do-you-use-any-third-party-services-to-send-emails'>So you donâ€™t use any third-party services to send emails?</h3>

    <p>No. Emails are sent using <a href='https://github.com/small-tech/web0/blob/main/.dynamic/sendMail.js'>code weâ€™ve written</a> that contacts your mail server directly.</p>

    <p><em>(Email is actually quite a simple protocol and the needs of this site are very basic. See Aralâ€™s video on <a href='https://ar.al/2021/12/20/how-to-send-an-email/'>How to send an email</a> by manually talking to an email server if youâ€™re into that sort of thing.)</em></p>

    <p>Yes, of course.</p>

      <p class='trivia'>Not that thereâ€™s anything wrong with it but this site doesnâ€™t use any client-side JavaScript. What about the form validation?
