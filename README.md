## Development

This site is powered by [Site.js](https://sitejs.org).

Once youâ€™ve installed Site.js:

1. Clone this repository and switch to its directory in Terminal.

2. Install node dependencies:
    ```
    ./install
    ```
3. Run Site.js locally as a development server:

    ```
    site
    ```

Hit `https://localhost` and you will have the site up and running locally.

_Note that the email functionality cannot be tested locally and is hard-coded for web0.small-web.org._
